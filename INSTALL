Install/Upgrade Instructions:

- Run build-igor script with appropriate flags to build the executables. Use
  the -h flag for usage help. You need the tar archive to do an automated
  install.

- Copy the igor2.tar.gz file and install-igor script to your target system.

- If you are upgrading Igor's main server or web front-end you will need to
  stop these applications before running the install-igor script in the next
  step.

- If you are upgrading, then as root, navigate to the db-migrate folder and
  run the executable to upgrade igor's database. Depending on the upgrade
  version there may not be any changes to apply, but it will ensure the
  database version you are using is the correct one. Return to the parent
  folder after you finish this step.

- As root, run the install-igor script for both first-time installation or
  upgrading from an earlier version. If you have installed Igor in custom
  or non-traditional locations on your system, you may need to edit some of
  the path variables in the install-igor script.
