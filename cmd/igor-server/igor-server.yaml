#
# ---------------- IGOR SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE ----------------
#
# This configuration file is designed to get igor up and running quickly. If a field has a default indicated that is
# the value that will be used if the field is left blank. Review carefully for required fields. At startup the server 
# will print all finalized config values to the igor log file for review. Password settings are masked in the log file 
# output for security.


# -- ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS --

# instanceName (string) - Specifies the name of this igor instance. This is an optional label that helps distinguish
# which igor server is emailing users. It is highly recommended setting this label if multiple igor servers are
# reachable within the same organization. Ex: R&D Cluster Lab
# Default: igor
instanceName:


# -- SERVER SETTINGS -- 
# Server setup. The relevant settings will make connections to the REST API available at https://[host]:[port]/igor
server:

  # host (string) - Igor server host name or IP. If left blank will call 'hostname -f' at startup to get the FQDN for
  # use in this field. Alternatively you can specify the hostname or an IP directly, including 0.0.0.0 or localhost.
  # Default: FQDN, if available
  host:

  # port (int) - Igor server port for accepting connections from clients. Change this if the default is not suitable
  # for your cluster head node.
  # Default: 8443
  port:

  # cbHost (string) - Igor server host name or IP for the callback/fileserver. If left blank will call 'hostname -f'
  # at startup to get the FQDN for use in this field. Alternatively you can specify the hostname or an IP directly,
  # including 0.0.0.0 or localhost.
  # Default: FQDN, if available
  cbHost:

  # cbPort (int) - Igor server port for accepting connections from cluster nodes. If left blank it will use the next
  # highest value defined by the 'port' setting above. Otherwise, set its value to something else.
  # Default: port+1 (8444 if using port default)
  cbPort:

  # certFile/keyFile (string) - Paths to certificate and key files used by HTTPS. Igor requires HTTPS on its client
  # API calls. A self-signed certificate is allowed. These paths must be absolute.
  # REQUIRED. Cannot be left blank.
  certFile: /path/to/host.crt
  keyFile: /path/to/host.key

  # cbUseTLS (bool) - If true, callback/file server accepts connections from cluster nodes over HTTPS using the same
  # certs as the API server. Otherwise it uses the plain HTTP protocol.
  # Default: true
  cbUseTLS:

  # allowedOrigins (string list) - A list of acceptable origins for igorweb connecting to the server. This should
  # include any remote node where the igorweb server is installed and include the port number it uses. If an
  # igorweb server is running on the same node as this server it must still be included in origin list since CORS
  # treats the different port as a cross-site origin. The HTTPS scheme will be applied to each entry.
  # Example:
  #    - head1.myclustersite.com:3000
  #    - head2.myclustersite.com:3050
  # Default: (blank -- but REQURIED if igorweb is being used!)
  allowedOrigins:
    - localhost:3000
    
  # allowPublicShow (true|false) - Enables an API call at GET https://[host]:[port]/igor/public that can be reached
  # without the need to authenticate the requester. The information returned is a plain text message in CSV format
  # with a header row summarizing the reservations on the cluster similar to 'igor show'. This is a handy way to let
  # user scripts poll for info without needing to be logged in. If false, the URL returns a 403 Forbidden status and
  # message.
  # Default: false
  allowPublicShow:

  # dnsServer (string) - The host or IP address of the DNS server that can resolve cluster node hostnames.
  # This setting is not required if the hostname lookup is available in /etc/hosts
  # Default: (blank)
  dnsServer:

  # tftpRoot (string) - the location where igor should store PXE boot files (same path as pxelinux.cfg, exclusive).
  # If the path is empty or inaccessible, $IGOR_HOME will be used.
  # Default: $IGOR_HOME/pxelinux.cfg
  tftpRoot:

  # imageStagePath is the filepath where the server will create the 'igor_staged_images' folder as the image stage path
  # KI pair files should be placed in the imageStagePath/igor_staged_images directory to register or create a distro with.
  # When -kstaged/-istaged flags are used when creating a Distro, Igor will use this path to look for those files.
  # If the path is inaccessible or config is blank, $IGOR_HOME/igor_staged_images will be used instead.
  # Default: $IGOR_HOME/igor_staged_images
  imageStagePath:

  # scriptDir (string) - The filepath where the server will create the 'scripts' folder where Kickstarter and other scripts
  # and templates reside that are needed to support booting certain OS images.
  # If the path is inaccessible or config is blank, $IGOR_HOME/scripts will be used instead.
  # Default: $IGOR_HOME/scripts
  scriptDir:

  # allowImageUpload (true|false) - Specify whether to allow a user to upload a KI pair directly through the cli/web
  # interface to build a new distro. If false, igor will only create distros from KI pairs placed in the
  # imageStageDir/igor_staged_images path. This would normally be something only a sysadmin could do.
  # Default: false
  allowImageUpload:

  # userLocalBootDC (true|false) - Restrict Local Boot Distro creation. If false, restricts the creation of 
  # local boot distros to be admin only. If true, any user can create a distro using a local-boot-only image.
  # Distros with images intended for local boot require a kickstart script to be associated with the distro.
  # Default: false
  userLocalBootDC:


# -- AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS --

  # Default: changeMe$1 
  defaultUserPassword:

  # tokenDuration (integer) - Specifies the duration (in hours) a generated authentication token is valid for a
  # given user. When the token expires the user must re-authenticate. Applies both to igorweb and CLI client.

  elevateTimeout:

  # -- (OPTIONAL) LDAP SETTINGS --
  # If scheme is set to an LDAP option, igor will use it as an enhanced authentication strategy. LDAP at a minimum
  # requires a host (server address) and baseDN depending on your LDAP service configuration. If LDAP isn't being
  # used then settings in this section are ignored.

    # Ex: [ att ]
    # Default: (blank)
    attributes:

    # GROUP_SYNC - Igor can syncronize its user list with a provided group in LDAP. With this feature enabled, Igor 
    # will start with a worker that will regularly connect to LDAP using the settings provided above, then pull a 
    # list of all members of the given group. Igor will compare the list of members with its user table. Any member 
    # of the group that is not a member of Igor will be created as a new Igor user. Conversely, if there is an existing 
    # Igor user that is not found in the group member list, the user will be disabled. 
    groupSync:

      # enableGroupSync (bool) - If true, Igor will launch a worker that periodically syncs its user list with the
      # members of the specified group using LDAP. Default: false
      # NOTE: In order to use this feature, you must:

      # Default: (blank)
      groupMemberAttributeEmail:

      # groupAttributeDisplayName (string) - the key for the Entity Attribute display name Value. This is needed for Igor 
      # to know what key to use to extract the user's full/display from an LDAP response entry. If a display name is not

  # Default: igor.log 
  file:

  # Igor supports optional writing to a syslog endpoint on the local machine or over a network.
  # Note that if this option is enabled it is best to keep the logging level at 'info' or above to avoid extremely
  # verbose output in syslog files.
  syslog:

    # network (string) - Defines what kind of syslog endpoint to connect to.
    # Accepted values: none, local, or see https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial for a list of acceptable values for network field.
    # Default: none
    network:

# -- VLAN SETTINGS --
# These settings configure a VLAN service provided by a network switch allowing reservation nodes to communicate with
# each other on a private LAN.
vlan:

  # network (string) - The name of the switch/service you wish to use. Leaving this setting blank turns off VLAN service

  # port 25. Fill in a port number to override the default.
  # Default: 587
  smtpPort:

  # smtpUser (string) - Username if your SMTP server requires authentication to send email. Note that this may require
  # you to create a real email service account for igor. A real user account is not recommended for this purpose.
  # Leave blank if not required.
  # Default: (blank)
  smtpUsername:

  # smtpPassword (string) - Password if your SMTP server requires authentication to send email. Note that this may require

  replyTo:

  # helpLink (string) - An optional link that points to a cluster admin team's FAQ/support page or other help resource.
  # If provided it will be embedded in emails that are sent by igor to users.
  # Default: (blank)
  helpLink:

  # defaultSuffix (string) - The domain name for emails generated by igor. The 'From' address will be igor-admin@{defaultSuffix}.
  # Note that this address is not expected to be a reply email unless you also specify it in the replyTo setting and have
  # an email account set up in that name.
  # REQUIRED. Cannot be left blank.
  defaultSuffix: mydomain.com

  # resNotifyOn (true|false) - Determines if email notifications about reservations starting and stopping are sent. This
  # setting does not affect any other kind of email igor sends (password changes, etc.).
  # Default: true
  resNotifyOn:

  # resNotifyTimes (string) - A comma-delimited list of time values indicating the instance at which an email will be
  # sent to notify about a pending reservation expiring. (ex. 1d,12h would sent emails at one day prior to expiration
  # and 12 hours prior). The smallest value possible is 1 hour. The last notification will always be sent with high
  # priority to make it easier for users to see in their inbox. You can configure as many as you like but consider the
  # impact of overwhelming users with unnecessary emails. This setting is ignored if resNotifyOn is set to false.
  # Default: 3d,1d
  resNotifyTimes:


# -- RESERVATION SCHEDULER SETTINGS --
# These settings define global limits on how reservations can be made and extended.
scheduler:

  # nodeReserveLimit (int) - The maximum number of public nodes a user can be granted per reservation. This setting does
  # NOT affect reserving restricted nodes if the owner belongs to an allowed access group.
  # Elevated admins ignore this setting and can always make a reservation using as many nodes as are available.
  # Default: 0
  nodeReserveLimit:

  # maxScheduleDays (int) - The amount of time (in days) from today that defines the period during which reservations can
  # be made. For example, assuming today's date is Jan 1, 2022 @ 5PM, a value of 90 days would disallow reservations whose
  # end date was later than March 31, 2022 @ 5PM.
  # This setting differs from maxReserveTime which sets the maximum duration a reservation can last.
  # If left blank or > 1457 then the maximum of 1457 is used (4 years including 1 leap day)
  # Elevated admins ignore this setting and can always use the maximum possible value.
  # Default: 1457
  maxScheduleDays:

  # minReserveTime (int) - The smallest amount of time (in minutes) a create reservation request is allowed. This cannot
  # be set to less than 10 minutes. Care should be taken in setting this value too low if nodes on the cluster take a long
  # time to spin up.
  # Accepted values: >= 10, <= defaultReserveTime, or blank for default
  # Default: 30
  minReserveTime:

  # defaultReserveTime (int) - The amount of time (in minutes) a reservation lasts if no duration value is specified in a
  # reservation create request. This value cannot be less than minReserveTime.
  # Default: 60
  # Accepted values: >= minReserveTime, <= maxReserveTime, or blank for default
  defaultReserveTime:

  # maxReserveTime (int) - The maximum amount of time (in minutes) a reservation can last from current wall clock time to
  # expiration. Example: 30 days = 60*24*30 = 43200. If a reservation is made for 30 days and is extended 7 days later by
  # the maximum allowable then the reservation's new expiration time will be 30 days from that moment, effectively adding
  # 7 more days to the reservation.
  #
  # The max possible value is 2098080 minutes (4 years including 1 leap day). However, setting this to the max possible
  # value is probably not a good idea.
  #
  # This value is meant to apply to normal igor users. Elevated admins can make/extend reservations of any length up to
  # the maximum defined in maxScheduleDays.It cannot be set to a number in the range [1,defaultReserveTime).
  # Accepted values: >= defaultReserveTime, <= 2098080, or blank for default
  # Default: 43200
  maxReserveTime:

  # extendWithin (int) - The number of minutes prior to the end of a reservation during which a user can run the extend
  # command. This value is bounded by maxReserveTime; setting it the same or higher will mean the user can extend
  # immediately after reservation create, but the amount of extension time granted is still no greater than maxReserveTime.
  #
  # It is good to set a reasonable window of time during which extend can be run as this helps other users to reserve
  # nodes in the future when the cluster is busy. Setting this param to maxReserveTime would allow someone running a
  # script every minute to keep pushing out the end time of their reservation and effectively hog access to those nodes.
  #
  # IMPORTANT! --- If set to -1, reservation extensions are disabled and users may only get them through admin intervention.
  #
  # Example: 4320 would allow the extend command to be run up to 3 days before a reservation is set to expire.
  # Default: 4320
  extendWithin:


# -- RESERVATION MAINTENANCE SETTINGS --
# These settings define features for how reservations can be padded with maintenance times and hosts can be booted with a 
# default image when not in use. You can register an image to Igor with a special flag to indicate it as a default image which
# Igor should install to a host once a reservation it's associated with ends. See the admin guide for details on registering
# a default image.
maintenance:

  # hostMaintenanceDuration (int) - The maximum number of minutes the host(s) of a reservation will be made unavailable after
  # the reservation has ended. A value greater than 0 is required if using Igor to install a default image to a host after
  # a reservation ends. You should put a sufficient amount of time to allow Igor to install the image to the host to avoid  
  # colliding with the start time of a new reservation. This may lead to an incomplete overwrite of the host.
  # Default: 0
  hostMaintenanceDuration:

  
# -- EXTERNAL COMMAND SETTINGS --
# Specifies parameters and commands that igor will use when calling other apps to perform actions on cluster nodes.
externalCmds:

  # commandRetries (int) - the number of times an external command will be retried if it reports an error
  # Default: 0
  commandRetries:

  # powerOff (string) - the command used to turn off nodes in the cluster. This is executed as bash command to whichever
  # service is being used for this purpose.
  # Default: (blank)
  powerOff:

  # powerOn (string) - the command used to turn on/boot nodes in the cluster. This is executed as bash command to whichever
  # service is being used for this purpose.
  # Default: (blank)
  powerOn:

  # powerCycle (string) - the command used to cycle power to nodes in the cluster. This is executed as bash command to whichever
  # service is being used for this purpose. If powerOff and powerOn are specified but powerCycle is blank, Igor will send
  # an off command, then on command in sequence instead.
  # Default: (blank)
  powerCycle:
